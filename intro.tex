This paper describes the ewic.cls class file which can be used to
convert articles produced with other \LaTeXe\ class files into the
correct form for publication by \emph{Electronic Workshops in
Computing}.

The ewic.cls class file preserves much of the standard \LaTeXe\
interface so that any document which has been produced using the
standard \LaTeXe\ article style can easily be converted to work
with the ewic style. However, the width of text and typesize may
vary from that of \emph{article}; therefore \emph{line breaks will
change} and it is possible that computer listings and displayed
mathematics may need resetting.

In the following sections we describe how to lay out your code to
use ewic.cls to reproduce the typographical look required for
online publication. However, this short paper is not a guide to
using \LaTeXe\ and we would refer you to any of the many books
available (see, for example, \cite{Companion,KopkaDaly,Lamport}).
